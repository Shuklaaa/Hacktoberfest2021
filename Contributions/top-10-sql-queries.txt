1. Create a Table
CREATE statement in SQL is used to create a new table in your database. 

Syntax to CREATE a table: 

CREATE TABLE table_name(column1 datatype, column2 datatype, … columnN datatype);

2. Select Query
SELECT is the most commonly used statement in SQL. The SELECT Statement in SQL is used for viewing all records from a table. The data returned is stored in a result table. These result tables are called result sets. 

Syntax to SELECT a query:

SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name;
where, column1, column2… are the names of fields of a table, table_name is from where we will fetch the records.

Below is the query to fetch the fields EMP_ID, NAME, and AGE from the table Employee:

SELECT EMP_ID, NAME, AGE FROM Employee;                                                         

Below is the given syntax, if you want to fetch all the fields in the table:

SELECT * FROM table_name;
To fetch all the fields from the table Employee:

SELECT * FROM Employee;

3. Insert Query
The INSERT Statement in SQL is used to insert records into a table. The INSERT INTO declaration is used to insert new records in a table. 

Syntax to INSERT a tuple:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, … columnN) VALUES (value1, value2, … valueN;
Here, column1, and column2… are the names of fields of a table.

Below is the query to add the fields EMP_ID, NAME, and AGE in the table Employee:

INSERT INTO employee (EMP_ID, NAME, SALARY, AGE) VALUES ('1', 'Rajesh', 25000, 30);      
INSERT INTO employee (EMP_ID, NAME, SALARY, AGE) VALUES ('2', 'Suresh', 30000, 45);
INSERT INTO employee (EMP_ID, NAME, SALARY, AGE) VALUES ('3', 'Andy', 28000, 40);   

4. Delete Records From a Table
The DELETE Statement in SQL is used to delete some selected records from a table. 

Syntax to DELETE a record:

DELETE FROM employee WHERE [condition];
Below is the query to delete the record from the table Employee:

DELETE FROM employee WHERE EMP_ID = '1';                                                         

5. Update Data in Records From a Table
The UPDATE Statement in SQL is used to update/modify the data in the existing records from a table. 

Syntax to UPDATE records:

UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, … WHERE [condition];
Below is the query to delete the record from the table Employee:

UPDATE employee SET age = 38 WHERE EMP_ID = '4';                
SELECT * FROM employee;                                     

6. Viewing Only Selected Records From a Table
Using this query, we can get only the selected records from the table.

Syntax to view only the selected records:

SELECT COUNT (1) FROM table_name;
Below is the query to view only the selected records from the table Employee:

SELECT COUNT (1) FROM employee;                                      

7. Viewing Records From a Table
Using this query, we can get the selected records without knowing the exact details from the table.

Syntax to UPDATE records:

SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE [condition];
Below is the query to view the records from the table Employee without knowing the details:

SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name LIKE 'a%y';                

8. Where Query
Below is the query to retrieve records using more than one condition using the WHERE statement from the table:

SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name = 'Andy' AND age = 40;                


9. Viewing Only Selected Columns From a Table
Below is the query to view only the selected columns from the table Employee:

SELECT name FROM employee WHERE age > 39;                

You can also select more than one column from the table:

SELECT name, emp_id FROM employee WHERE age > 39;            

10. Performance of the Query
Below is the advanced query which is useful if you need to get why a query is so slow.

EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE;
